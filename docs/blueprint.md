# **App Name**: CodeFlow

## Core Features:

- Integrated Code Editor: An intuitive, multi-tab code editor with syntax highlighting for Python, designed for efficient script writing.
- Script Library Management: A sidebar panel to create new files, open existing ones, rename, and delete Python scripts.
- Run and Debug Controls: A dedicated button to execute the currently open Python script, and basic debugging feedback (e.g., error highlighting).
- Console Output Display: An integrated console panel to display the output, errors, and standard streams from script execution.
- Persistent Script Storage: Ability to save and load user-written Python scripts, maintaining their content across sessions (e.g., via browser local storage or simple file persistence).
- AI Code Assistant Tool: An integrated AI tool that can suggest code completions, explain code snippets, or offer refactoring tips directly within the editor, and also generate the basic structure of a python script from a textual prompt.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Dark theme, providing a focused environment suitable for coding.
- Primary color: A medium-bright blue (#4192F1) for interactive elements, current file indicators, and main CTAs. It signifies a clear, technical, and dependable interface, contrasting effectively against dark backgrounds.
- Background color: A very dark, desaturated blue (#1A1E24) to create a 'deep blue' feel, providing a calm backdrop that allows code and primary elements to stand out.
- Accent color: A subtle violet (#BC82E4) used for secondary highlighting, non-critical notifications, and specific syntax elements within the editor, offering a gentle visual contrast to the primary blue.
- Headline and body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its modern, clean, and highly readable design, ideal for an objective coding environment.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace sans-serif) for all code snippets and editor content, ensuring consistent character width and excellent readability for programming.
- Minimalist, flat icons that are clearly recognizable and integrate seamlessly into a professional developer interface. Use line-based icons where possible.
- A paneled layout featuring a clear separation for the file explorer, code editor, and console output, optimizing screen space for multitasking.
- Subtle, smooth transitions for opening/closing panels, file changes, and focus indicators to enhance user experience without distraction.
